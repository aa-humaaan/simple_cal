## Simple Calculator in Python

This program is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Key Features

* **Robust Input Handling:** Ensures users enter valid floating-point numbers using the `get_float_input` function.
* **Modular Design:** Separates calculation logic into the `calculate` function for better organization and reusability.
* **Error Handling:** Handles division by zero and invalid operation symbols using `try...except` blocks, providing informative error messages.

### How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the desired operation (+, -, *, /).
4. Enter the second number when prompted.
5. The program will display the result or an error message if applicable.

### Example

```
Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Enter the first value: 5.2
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter the second value: 2
Result: 2.6
```

### Notes

* The program can handle decimal numbers.
* Division by zero is not allowed and will result in an error message.
* Any invalid operation symbol will also result in an error message.

### Additional Information

This code demonstrates good practices for building a more robust and user-friendly calculator. You can extend this program to include functionalities like:

* More mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus)
* User interface improvements (e.g., graphical interface)
* Memory functions for storing and recalling previous results

Feel free to modify and improve this code as needed!
